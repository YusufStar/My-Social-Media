You can share and comment on posts<br/>
You can follow other users. The people you follow will be notified. You can see your notifications on the Notifications page.<br/>
If you want to see your followers and what you follow, you can find them on My Community page.<br/>
I was going to make the Messages part private, but then it made more sense to have a chat where everyone can write. This chat exists for all users to chat and meet.<br/>
In the Profile section, you can see your own profile and the posts you have shared.<br/>
Instead of making a modal for logout, I made a page. If you say yes to the question are you sure, you will log out, if you say no, it will redirect you to the homepage.<br/>
