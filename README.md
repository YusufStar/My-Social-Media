You can share and comment on posts
You can follow other users. The people you follow will be notified. You can see your notifications on the Notifications page.
If you want to see your followers and what you follow, you can find them on My Community page.
I was going to make the Messages part private, but then it made more sense to have a chat where everyone can write. This chat exists for all users to chat and meet.
In the Profile section, you can see your own profile and the posts you have shared.
Instead of making a modal for logout, I made a page. If you say yes to the question are you sure, you will log out, if you say no, it will redirect you to the homepage.
